# [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23463279-designing-data-intensive-applications)

## Reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications

A data-intensive application is typically built from standard building blocks. They usually need to:
* Store data (_databases_)
* Speed up reads (_caches_)
* Search data (_search indexes_)
* Send a message to another process asynchronously (_stream processing_)
* Periodically crunch data (_batch processing_)

* **Reliability**. To work _correctly_ even in the face of _adversity_.
* **Scalability**. Reasonable ways of dealing with growth.
* **Maintainability**. Be able to work on it _productively_.

### Reliability

Typical expectations:
* Application performs the function the user expected
* Tolerate the user making mistakes
* Its performance is good
* The system prevents abuse

Systems that anticipate faults and can cope with them are called _fault-tolerant_ or _resilient_.

**A fault is usually defined as one component of the system deviating from its spec**, whereas _failure_ is when the system as a whole stops providing the required service to the user.

You should generally **prefer tolerating faults over preventing faults**.

* **Hardware faults**. Until recently redundancy of hardware components was sufficient for most applications. As data volumes increase, more applications use a larger number of machines, proportionally increasing the rate of hardware faults. **There is a move towards systems that tolerate the loss of entire machines**. A system that tolerates machine failure can be patched one node at a time, without downtime of the entire system (_rolling upgrade_).
* **Software errors**. It is unlikely that a large number of hardware components will fail at the same time. Software errors are a systematic error within the system, they tend to cause many more system failures than uncorrelated hardware faults.
* **Human errors**. Humans are known to be unreliable. Configuration errors by operators are a leading cause of outages. You can make systems more reliable:
    - Minimising the opportunities for error, peg: with admin interfaces that make easy to do the "right thing" and discourage the "wrong thing".
    - Provide fully featured non-production _sandbox_ environments where people can explore and experiment safely.
    - Automated testing.
    - Quick and easy recovery from human error, fast to rollback configuration changes, roll out new code gradually and tools to recompute data.
    - Set up detailed and clear monitoring, such as performance metrics and error rates (_telemetry_).
    - Implement good management practices and training.

### Scalability

This is how do we cope with increased load. We need to succinctly describe the current load on the system; only then we can discuss growth questions.

---

#### Twitter example

Twitter main operations
- Post tweet: a user can publish a new message to their followers (4.6k req/sec, over 12k req/sec peak)
- Home timeline: a user can view tweets posted by the people they follow (300k req/sec)

Two ways of implementing those operations:
1. Posting a tweet simply inserts the new tweet into a global collection of tweets. When a user requests their home timeline, look up all the people they follow, find all the tweets for those users, and merge them (sorted by time). This could be done with a SQL `JOIN`.
2. Maintain a cache for each user's home timeline. When a user _posts a tweet_, look up all the people who follow that user, and insert the new tweet into each of their home timeline caches.

Approach 1, systems struggle to keep up with the load of home timeline queries. So the company switched to approach 2. The average rate of published tweets is almost two orders of magnitude lower than the rate of home timeline reads.

Downside of approach 2 is that posting a tweet now requires a lot of extra work. Some users have over 30 million followers. A single tweet may result in over 30 million writes to home timelines.

Twitter moved to an hybrid of both approaches. Tweets continue to be fanned out to home timelines but a small number of users with a very large number of followers are fetched separately and merged with that user's home timeline when it is read, like in approach 1.

---

#### Describing performance

What happens when the load increases:
* How is the performance affected?
* How much do you need to increase your resources?

In a batch processing system such as Hadoop, we usually care about _throughput_, or the number of records we can process per second.

> ##### Latency and response time
> The response time is what the client sees. Latency is the duration that a request is waiting to be handled.

It's common to see the _average_ response time of a service reported. However, the mean is not very good metric if you want to know your "typical" response time, it does not tell you how many users actually experienced that delay.

**Better to use percentiles.**
* _Median_ (_50th percentile_ or _p50_). Half of user requests are served in less than the median response time, and the other half take longer than the median
* Percentiles _95th_, _99th_ and _99.9th_ (_p95_, _p99_ and _p999_) are good to figure out how bad your outliners are.

Amazon describes response time requirements for internal services in terms of the 99.9th percentile because the customers with the slowest requests are often those who have the most data. The most valuable customers.

On the other hand, optimising for the 99.99th percentile would be too expensive.

_Service level objectives_ (SLOs) and _service level agreements_ (SLAs) are contracts that define the expected performance and availability of a service.
An SLA may state the median response time to be less than 200ms and a 99th percentile under 1s. **These metrics set expectations for clients of the service and allow customers to demand a refund if the SLA is not met.**

Queueing delays often account for large part of the response times at high percentiles. **It is important to measure times on the client side.**

When generating load artificially, the client needs to keep sending requests independently of the response time.

> ##### Percentiles in practice
> Calls in parallel, the end-user request still needs to wait for the slowest of the parallel calls to complete.
> The chance of getting a slow call increases if an end-user request requires multiple backend calls.

#### Approaches for coping with load

* _Scaling up_ or _vertical scaling_: Moving to a more powerful machine
* _Scaling out_ or _horizontal scaling_: Distributing the load across multiple smaller machines.
* _Elastic_ systems: Automatically add computing resources when detected load increase. Quite useful if load is unpredictable.

Distributing stateless services across multiple machines is fairly straightforward. Taking stateful data systems from a single node to a distributed setup can introduce a lot of complexity. Until recently it was common wisdom to keep your database on a single node.

### Maintainability

The majority of the cost of software is in its ongoing maintenance. There are three design principles for software systems:
* **Operability**. Make it easy for operation teams to keep the system running.
* **Simplicity**. Easy for new engineers to understand the system by removing as much complexity as possible.
* **Evolvability**. Make it easy for engineers to make changes to the system in the future.

#### Operability: making life easy for operations

A good operations team is responsible for
* Monitoring and quickly restoring service if it goes into bad state
* Tracking down the cause of problems
* Keeping software and platforms up to date
* Keeping tabs on how different systems affect each other
* Anticipating future problems
* Establishing good practices and tools for development
* Perform complex maintenance tasks, like platform migration
* Maintaining the security of the system
* Defining processes that make operations predictable
* Preserving the organisation's knowledge about the system

**Good operability means making routine tasks easy.**

#### Simplicity: managing complexity

When complexity makes maintenance hard, budget and schedules are often overrun. There is a greater risk of introducing bugs.

Making a system simpler means removing _accidental_ complexity, as non inherent in the problem that the software solves (as seen by users).

One of the best tools we have for removing accidental complexity is _abstraction_ that hides the implementation details behind clean and simple to understand APIs and facades.

#### Evolvability: making change easy

_Agile_ working patterns provide a framework for adapting to change.

* _Functional requirements_: what the application should do
* _Nonfunctional requirements_: general properties like security, reliability, compliance, scalability, compatibility and maintainability.

## Data models and query language

Most applications are built by layering one data model on top of another. Each layer hides the complexity of the layers below by providing a clean data model. These abstractions allow different groups of people to work effectively.

### Relational model vs document model

The roots of relational databases lie in _business data processing_, _transaction processing_ and _batch processing_.

The goal was to hide the implementation details behind a cleaner interface.

_Not Only SQL_ has a few driving forces:
* Greater scalability
* preference for free and open source software
* Specialised query optimisations
* Desire for a more dynamic and expressive data model

**With a SQL model, if data is stored in a relational tables, an awkward translation layer is translated, this is called _impedance mismatch_.**

JSON model reduces the impedance mismatch and the lack of schema is often cited as an advantage.

JSON representation has better _locality_ than the multi-table SQL schema. All the relevant information is in one place, and one query is sufficient.

In relational databases, it's normal to refer to rows in other tables by ID, because joins are easy. In document databases, joins are not needed for one-to-many tree structures, and support for joins is often weak.

If the database itself does not support joins, you have to emulate a join in application code by making multiple queries.

The most popular database for business data processing in the 1970s was the IBM's _Information Management System_ (IMS).

IMS used a _hierarchical model_ and like document databases worked well for one-to-many relationships, but it made many-to-,any relationships difficult, and it didn't support joins.

#### The network model

Standardised by a committee called the Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL) model was a generalisation of the hierarchical model. In the tree structure of the hierarchical model, every record has exactly one parent, while in the network model, a record could have multiple parents.

The links between records are like pointers in a programming language. The only way of accessing a record was to follow a path from a root record called _access path_.

A query in CODASYL was performed by moving a cursor through the database by iterating over a list of records. If you didn't have a path to the data you wanted, you were in a difficult situation as it was difficult to make changes to an application's data model.

#### The relational model

By contrast, the relational model was a way to lay out all the data in the open" a relation (table) is simply a collection of tuples (rows), and that's it.

The query optimiser automatically decides which parts of the query to execute in which order, and which indexes to use (the access path).

The relational model thus made it much easier to add new features to applications.

---

**The main arguments in favour of the document data model are schema flexibility, better performance due to locality, and sometimes closer data structures to the ones used by the applications. The relation model counters by providing better support for joins, and many-to-one and many-to-many relationships.**

If the data in your application has a document-like structure, then it's probably a good idea to use a document model. The relational technique of _shredding_ can lead unnecessary complicated application code.

The poor support for joins in document databases may or may not be a problem.

If you application does use many-to-many relationships, the document model becomes less appealing. Joins can be emulated in application code by making multiple requests. Using the document model can lead to significantly more complex application code and worse performance.

#### Schema flexibility

Most document databases do not enforce any schema on the data in documents. Arbitrary keys and values can be added to a document, when reading, **clients have no guarantees as to what fields the documents may contain.**

Document databases are sometimes called _schemaless_, but maybe a more appropriate term is _schema-on-read_, in contrast to _schema-on-write_.

Schema-on-read is similar to dynamic (runtime) type checking, whereas schema-on-write is similar to static (compile-time) type checking.

The schema-on-read approach if the items on the collection don't have all the same structure (heterogeneous)
* Many different types of objects
* Data determined by external systems


#### Data locality for queries

If your application often needs to access the entire document, there is a performance advantage to this _storage locality_.

The database typically needs to load the entire document, even if you access only a small portion of it. On updates, the entire document usually needs to be rewritten, it is recommended that you keep documents fairly small.

#### Convergence of document and relational databases

PostgreSQL does support JSON documents. RethinkDB supports relational-like joins in its query language and some MongoDB drivers automatically resolve database references. Relational and document databases are becoming more similar over time.

### Query languages for data

SQL is a _declarative_ query language. In an _imperative language_, you tell the computer to perform certain operations in order.

In a declarative query language you just specify the pattern of the data you want, but not _how_ to achieve that goal.

A declarative query language hides implementation details of the database engine, making it possible for the database system to introduce performance improvements without requiring any changes to queries.

Declarative languages often lend themselves to parallel execution while imperative code is very hard to parallelise across multiple cores because it specifies instructions that must be performed in a particular order. Declarative languages specify only the pattern of the results, not the algorithm that is used to determine results.

#### Declarative queries on the web

In a web browser, using declarative CSS styling is much better than manipulating styles imperatively in JavaScript. Declarative languages like SQL turned out to be much better than imperative query APIs.

#### MapReduce querying

_MapReduce_ is a programming model for processing large amounts of data in bulk across many machines, popularised by Google.

Mongo offers a MapReduce solution.

```js
db.observations.mapReduce(
    function map() { 2
        var year  = this.observationTimestamp.getFullYear();
        var month = this.observationTimestamp.getMonth() + 1;
        emit(year + "-" + month, this.numAnimals); 3
    },
    function reduce(key, values) { 4
        return Array.sum(values); 5
    },
    {
        query: { family: "Sharks" }, 1
        out: "monthlySharkReport" 6
    }
);
```

The `map` and `reduce` functions must be _pure_ functions, they cannot perform additional database queries and they must not have any side effects. These restrictions allow the database to run the functions anywhere, in any order, and rerun them on failure.

A usability problem with MapReduce is that you have to write two carefully coordinated functions. A declarative language offers more opportunities for a query optimiser to improve the performance of a query. For there reasons, MongoDB 2.2 added support for a declarative query language called _aggregation pipeline_

```js
db.observations.aggregate([
    { $match: { family: "Sharks" } },
    { $group: {
        _id: {
            year:  { $year:  "$observationTimestamp" },
            month: { $month: "$observationTimestamp" }
        },
        totalAnimals: { $sum: "$numAnimals" }
    } }
]);
```

### Graph-like data models

If many-to-many relationships are very common in your application, it becomes more natural to start modelling your data as a graph.

A graph consists of _vertices_ (_nodes_ or _entities_) and _edges_ (_relationships_ or _arcs_).

Well-known algorithms can operate on these graphs, like the shortest path between two points, or popularity of a web page.

There are several ways of structuring and querying the data. The _property graph_ model (implemented by Neo4j, Titan, and Infinite Graph) and the _triple-store_ model (implemented by Datomic, AllegroGraph, and others). There are also three declarative query languages for graphs: Cypher, SPARQL, and Datalog.

#### Property graphs

Each vertex consists of:
* Unique identifier
* Outgoing edges
* Incoming edges
* Collection of properties (key-value pairs)

Each edge consists of:
* Unique identifier
* Vertex at which the edge starts (_tail vertex_)
* Vertex at which the edge ends (_head vertex_)
* Label to describe the kind of relationship between the two vertices
* A collection of properties (key-value pairs)

Graphs provide a great deal of flexibility for data modelling. Graphs are good for evolvability.

---

* _Cypher_ is a declarative language for property graphs created by Neo4j
* Graph queries in SQL. In a relational database, you usually know in advance which joins you need in your query. In a graph query, the number if joins is not fixed in advance. In Cypher `:WITHIN*0...` expresses "follow a `WITHIN` edge, zero or more times" (like the `*` operator in a regular expression). This idea of variable-length traversal paths in a query can be expressed using something called _recursive common table expressions_ (the `WITH RECURSIVE` syntax).

---

#### Triple-stores and SPARQL

In a triple-store, all information is stored in the form of very simple three-part statements: _subject_, _predicate_, _object_ (peg: _Jim_, _likes_, _bananas_). A triple is equivalent to a vertex in graph.

#### The SPARQL query language

_SPARQL_ is a query language for triple-stores using the RDF data model.

#### The foundation: Datalog

_Datalog_ provides the foundation that later query languages build upon. Its model is similar to the triple-store model, generalised a bit. Instead of writing a triple (_subject_, _predicate_, _object_), we write as _predicate(subject, object)_.

We define _rules_ that tell the database about new predicates and rules can refer to other rules, just like functions can call other functions or recursively call themselves.

Rules can be combined and reused in different queries. It's less convenient for simple one-off queries, but it can cope better if your data is complex.

## Storage and retrieval

Databases need to do two things: store the data and give the data back to you.

### Data structures that power up your database

Many databases use a _log_, which is append-only data file. Real databases have more issues to deal with tho (concurrency control, reclaiming disk space so the log doesn't grow forever and handling errors and partially written records).

> A _log_ is an append-only sequence of records

In order to efficiently find the value for a particular key, we need a different data structure: an _index_. An index is an _additional_ structure that is derived from the primary data.

Well-chosen indexes speed up read queries but every index slows down writes. That's why databases don't index everything by default, but require you to choose indexes manually using your knowledge on typical query patterns.

#### Hash indexes

Key-value stores are quite similar to the _dictionary_ type (hash map or hash table).

Let's say our storage consists only of appending to a file. The simplest indexing strategy is to keep an in-memory hash map where every key is mapped to a byte offset in the data file. Whenever you append a new key-value pair to the file, you also update the hash map to reflect the offset of the data you just wrote.

Bitcask (the default storage engine in Riak) does it like that. The only requirement it has is that all the keys fit in the available RAM. Values can use more space than there is available in memory, since they can be loaded from disk.

A storage engine like Bitcask is well suited to situations where the value for each key is updated frequently. There are a lot of writes, but there are too many distinct keys, you have a large number of writes per key, but it's feasible to keep all keys in memory.

As we only ever append to a file, so how do we avoid eventually running out of disk space? **A good solution is to break the log into segments of certain size by closing the segment file when it reaches a certain size, and making subsequent writes to a new segment file. We can then perform _compaction_ on these segments.** Compaction means throwing away duplicate keys in the log, and keeping only the most recent update for each key.

We can also merge several segments together at the sae time as performing the compaction. Segments are never modified after they have been written, so the merged segment is written to a new file. Merging and compaction of frozen segments can be done in a background thread. After the merging process is complete, we switch read requests to use the new merged segment instead of the old segments, and the old segment files can simply be deleted.

Each segment now has its own in-memory hash table, mapping keys to file offsets. In order to find a value for a key, we first check the most recent segment hash map; if the key is not present we check the second-most recent segment and so on. The merging process keeps the number of segments small, so lookups don't need to check many hash maps.

Some issues that are important in a real implementation:
* File format. It is simpler to use binary format.
* Deleting records. Append special deletion record to the data file (_tombstone_) that tells the merging process to discard previous values.
* Crash recovery. If restarted, the in-memory hash maps are lost. You can recover from reading each segment but that would take long time. Bitcask speeds up recovery by storing a snapshot of each segment hash map on disk.
* Partially written records. The database may crash at any time. Bitcask includes checksums allowing corrupted parts of the log to be detected and ignored.
* Concurrency control. As writes are appended to the log in a strictly sequential order, a common implementation is to have a single writer thread. Segments are immutable, so they can be read concurrently by multiple threads.

Append-only design turns out to be good for several reasons:
* Appending and segment merging are sequential write operations, much faster than random writes, especially on magnetic spinning-disks.
* Concurrency and crash recovery are much simpler.
* Merging old segments avoids files getting fragmented over time.

Hash table has its limitations too:
* The hash table must fit in memory. It is difficult to make an on-disk hash map perform well.
* Range queries are not efficient.

#### SSTables and LSM-Trees

We introduce a new requirement to segment files: we require that the sequence of key-value pairs is _sorted by key_.

We call this _Sorted String Table_, or _SSTable_. We require that each key only appears once within each merged segment file (compaction already ensures that). SSTables have few big advantages over log segments with hash indexes
1. **Merging segments is simple and efficient** (we can use algorithms like _mergesort_). When multiple segments contain the same key, we can keep the value from the most recent segment and discard the values in older segments.
2. **You no longer need to keep an index of all the keys in memory.** For a key like `handiwork`, when you know the offsets for the keys `handback` and `handsome`, you know `handiwork` must appear between those two. You can jump to the offset for `handback` and scan from there until you find `handiwork`, if not, the key is not present. You still need an in-memory index to tell you the offsets for some of the keys. One key for every few kilobytes of segment file is sufficient.
3. Since read requests need to scan over several key-value pairs in the requested range anyway, **it is possible to group those records into a block and compress it** before writing it to disk.

How do we get the data sorted in the first place? With red-black trees or AVL trees, you can insert keys in any order and read them back in sorted order.
* When a write comes in, add it to an in-memory balanced tree structure (_memtable_).
* When the memtable gets bigger than some threshold (megabytes), write it out to disk as an SSTable file. Writes can continue to a new memtable instance.
* On a read request, try to find the key in the memtable, then in the most recent on-disk segment, then in the next-older segment, etc.
* From time to time, run merging and compaction in the background to discard overwritten and deleted values.

If the database crashes, the most recent writes are lost. We can keep a separate log on disk to which every write is immediately appended. That log is not in sorted order, but that doesn't matter, because its only purpose is to restore the memtable after crash. Every time the memtable is written out to an SSTable, the log can be discarded.

**Storage engines that are based on this principle of merging and compacting sorted files are often called LSM structure engines (Log Structure Merge-Tree).**

Lucene, an indexing engine for full-text search used by Elasticsearch and Solr, uses a similar method for storing its _term dictionary_.

LSM-tree algorithm can be slow when looking up keys that don't exist in the database. To optimise this, storage engines often use additional _Bloom filters_ (a memory-efficient data structure for approximating the contents of a set).

There are also different strategies to determine the order and timing of how SSTables are compacted and merged. Mainly two _size-tiered_ and _leveled_ compaction. LevelDB and RocksDB use leveled compaction, HBase use size-tiered, and Cassandra supports both. In size-tiered compaction, newer and smaller SSTables are successively merged into older and larger SSTables. In leveled compaction, the key range is split up into smaller SSTables and older data is moved into separate "levels", which allows the compaction to use less disk space.

#### B-trees

This is the most widely used indexing structure. B-tress keep key-value pairs sorted by key, which allows efficient key-value lookups and range queries.

The log-structured indexes break the database down into variable-size _segments_ typically several megabytes or more. B-trees break the database down into fixed-size _blocks_ or _pages_, traditionally 4KB.

One page is designated as the _root_ and you start from there. The page contains several keys and references to child pages.

If you want to update the value for an existing key in a B-tree, you search for the leaf page containing that key, change the value in that page, and write the page back to disk. If you want to add new key, find the page and add it to the page. If there isn't enough free space in the page to accommodate the new key, it is split in two half-full pages, and the parent page is updated to account for the new subdivision of key ranges.

Trees remain _balanced_. A B-tree with _n_ keys always has a depth of _O_(log _n_).

The basic underlying write operation of a B-tree is to overwrite a page on disk with new data. It is assumed that the overwrite does not change the location of the page, all references to that page remain intact. This is a big contrast to log-structured indexes such as LSM-trees, which only append to files.

Some operations require several different pages to be overwritten. When you split a page, you need to write the two pages that were split, and also overwrite their parent. If the database crashes after only some of the pages have been written, you end up with a corrupted index.

It is common to include an additional data structure on disk: a _write-ahead log_ (WAL, also know as the _redo log_).

Careful concurrency control is required if multiple threads are going to access, typically done protecting the tree internal data structures with _latches_ (lightweight locks).

#### B-trees and LSM-trees

LSM-trees are typically faster for writes, whereas B-trees are thought to be faster for reads. Reads are typically slower on LSM-tress as they have to check several different data structures and SSTables at different stages of compaction.

Advantages of LSM-trees:
* LSM-trees are typically able to sustain higher write throughput than B-trees, party because they sometimes have lower write amplification: a write to the database results in multiple writes to disk. The more a storage engine writes to disk, the fewer writes per second it can handle.
* LSM-trees can be compressed better, and thus often produce smaller files on disk than B-trees. B-trees tend to leave disk space unused due to fragmentation.

Downsides of LSM-trees:
* Compaction process can sometimes interfere with the performance of ongoing reads and writes. B-trees can be more predictable. The bigger the database, the the more disk bandwidth is required for compaction. Compaction cannot keep up with the rate of incoming writes, if not configured properly you can run out of disk space.
* On B-trees, each key exists in exactly one place in the index. This offers strong transactional semantics. Transaction isolation is implemented using locks on ranges of keys, and in a B-tree index, those locks can be directly attached to the tree.

#### Other indexing structures

We've only discussed key-value indexes, which are like _primary key_ index. There are also _secondary indexes_.

A secondary index can be easily constructed from a key-value index. The main difference is that in a secondary index, the indexed values are not necessarily unique. There are two ways of doing this: making each value in the index a list of matching row identifiers or by making a each entry unique by appending a row identifier to it.

#### Full-text search and fuzzy indexes

Indexes don't allow you to search for _similar_ keys, such as misspelled words. Such _fuzzy_ querying requires different techniques.

Full-text search engines allow synonyms, grammatical variations, occurrences of words near each other.

Lucene uses SSTable-like structure for its term dictionary. Lucene, the in-memory index is a finite state automaton, similar to a _trie_.

#### Keeping everything in memory

Disks have two significant advantages: they are durable, and they have lower cost per gigabyte than RAM.

It's quite feasible to keep them entirely in memory, this has lead to _in-memory_ databases.

Key-value stores, such as Memcached are intended for cache only, it's acceptable for data to be lost if the machine is restarted. Other in-memory databases aim for durability, with special hardware, writing a log of changes to disk, writing periodic snapshots to disk or by replicating in-memory sate to other machines.

When an in-memory database is restarted, it needs to reload its state, either from disk or over the network from a replica. The disk is merely used as an append-only log for durability, and reads are served entirely from memory.

Products such as VoltDB, MemSQL, and Oracle TimesTime are in-memory databases. Redis and Couchbase provide weak durability.

In-memory databases can be faster because they can avoid the overheads of encoding in-memory data structures in a form that can be written to disk.

Another interesting area is that in-memory databases may provide data models that are difficult to implement with disk-based indexes.

### Transaction processing or analytics?

A _transaction_ is a group of reads and writes that form a logical unit, this pattern became known as _online transaction processing_ (OLTP).

_Data analytics_ has very different access patterns. A query would need to scan over a huge number of records, only reading a few columns per record, and calculates aggregate statistics.

These queries are often written by business analysts, and fed into reports. This pattern became known for _online analytics processing_ (OLAP).


#### Data warehousing

A _data warehouse_ is a separate database that analysts can query to their heart's content without affecting OLTP operations. It contains read-only copy of the dat in all various OLTP systems in the company. Data is extracted out of OLTP databases (through periodic data dump or a continuous stream of update), transformed into an analysis-friendly schema, cleaned up, and then loaded into the data warehouse (process _Extract-Transform-Load_ or ETL).

A data warehouse is most commonly relational, but the internals of the systems can look quite different.

Amazon RedShift is hosted version of ParAccel. Apache Hive, Spark SQL, Cloudera Impala, Facebook Presto, Apache Tajo, and Apache Drill. Some of them are based on ideas from Google's Dremel.

Data warehouses are used in fairly formulaic style known as a _star schema_.

Facts are captured as individual events, because this allows maximum flexibility of analysis later. The fact table can become extremely large.

Dimensions represent the _who_, _what_, _where_, _when_, _how_ and _why_ of the event.

The name "star schema" comes from the fact than when the table relationships are visualised, the fact table is in the middle, surrounded by its dimension tables, like the rays of a star.

Fact tables often have over 100 columns, sometimes several hundred. Dimension tables can also be very wide.

### Column-oriented storage

In a row-oriented storage engine, when you do a query that filters on a specific field, the engine will load all those rows with all their fields into memory, parse them and filter out the ones that don't meet the requirement. This can take a long time.

_Column-oriented storage_ is simple: don't store all the values from one row together, but store all values from each _column_ together instead. If each column is stored in a separate file, a query only needs to read and parse those columns that are used in a query, which can save a lot of work.

Column-oriented storage often lends itself very well to compression as the sequences of values for each column look quite repetitive, which is a good sign for compression. A technique that is particularly effective in data warehouses is _bitmap encoding_.

Bitmap indexes are well suited for all kinds of queries that are common in a data warehouse.

> Cassandra and HBase have a concept of _column families_, which they inherited from Bigtable.

Besides reducing the volume of data that needs to be loaded from disk, column-oriented storage layouts are also good for making efficient use of CPU cycles (_vectorised processing_).

**Column-oriented storage, compression, and sorting helps to make read queries faster and make sense in data warehouses, where most of the load consist on large read-only queries run by analysts. The downside is that writes are more difficult.**

An update-in-place approach, like B-tree use, is not possible with compressed columns. If you insert a row in the middle of a sorted table, you would most likely have to rewrite all column files.

It's worth mentioning _materialised aggregates_ as some cache of the counts ant the sums that queries use most often. A way of creating such a cache is with a _materialised view_, on a relational model this is usually called a _virtual view_: a table-like object whose contents are the results of some query. A materialised view is an actual copy of the query results, written in disk, whereas a virtual view is just a shortcut for writing queries.

When the underlying data changes, a materialised view needs to be updated, because it is denormalised copy of the data. Database can do it automatically, but writes would become more expensive.

A common special case of a materialised view is know as a _data cube_ or _OLAP cube_, a grid of aggregates grouped by different dimensions.

## Encoding and evolution

Change to an application's features also requires a change to data it stores.

Relational databases conforms to one schema although that schema can be changed, there is one schema in force at any point in time. **Schema-on-read (or schemaless) contain a mixture of older and newer data formats.**

In large applications changes don't happen instantaneously. You want to perform a _rolling upgrade_ and deploy a new version to a few nodes at a time, gradually working your way through all the nodes without service downtime.

Old and new versions of the code, and old and new data formats, may potentially all coexist. We need to maintain compatibility in both directions
* Backward compatibility, newer code can read data that was written by older code.
* Forward compatibility, older code can read data that was written by newer code.

### Formats for encoding data

Two different representations:
* In memory
* When you want to write data to a file or send it over the network, you have to encode it

Thus, you need a translation between the two representations. In-memory representation to byte sequence is called _encoding_ (_serialisation_ or _marshalling_), and the reverse is called _decoding_ (_parsing_, _deserialisation_ or _unmarshalling_).

Programming languages come with built-in support for encoding in-memory objects into byte sequences, but is usually a bad idea to use them. Precisely because of a few problems.
* Often tied to a particular programming language.
* The decoding process needs to be able to instantiate arbitrary classes and this is frequently a security hole.
* Versioning
* Efficiency

Standardised encodings can be written and read by many programming languages.

JSON, XML, and CSV are human-readable and popular specially as data interchange formats, but they have some subtle problems:
* Ambiguity around the encoding of numbers and dealing with large numbers
* Support of Unicode character strings, but no support for binary strings. People get around this by encoding binary data as Base64, which increases the data size by 33%.
* There is optional schema support for both XML and JSON
* CSV does not have any schema

#### Binary encoding

JSON is less verbose than XML, but both still use a lot of space compared to binary formats. There are binary encodings for JSON (MesagePack, BSON, BJSON, UBJSON, BISON and Smile), similar thing for XML (WBXML and Fast Infoset).

**Apache Thrift and Protocol Buffers (protobuf) are binary encoding libraries.**

Thrift offers two different protocols:
* **BinaryProtocol**, there are no field names like `userName`, `favouriteNumber`. Instead the data contains _field tags_, which are numbers (`1`, `2`)
* **CompactProtocol**, which is equivalent to BinaryProtocol but it packs the same information in less space. It packs the field type and the tag number into the same byte.

Protocol Buffers are very similar to Thrift's CompactProtocol, bit packing is a bit different and that might allow smaller compression.

Schemas inevitable need to change over time (_schema evolution_), how do Thrift and Protocol Buffers handle schema changes while keeping backward and forward compatibility changes?

* **Forward compatible support**. As with new fields you add new tag numbers, old code trying to read new code, it can simply ignore not recognised tags.
* **Backwards compatible support**. As long as each field has a unique tag number, new code can always read old data. Every field you add after initial deployment of schema must be optional or have a default value.

Removing fields is just like adding a field with backward and forward concerns reversed. You can only remove a field that is optional, and you can never use the same tag again.

What about changing the data type of a field? There is a risk that values will lose precision or get truncated.

##### Avro

Apache Avro is another binary format that has two schema languages, one intended for human editing (Avro IDL), and one (based on JSON) that is more easily machine-readable.

You go go through the fields in the order they appear in the schema and use the schema to tell you the datatype of each field. Any mismatch in the schema between the reader and the writer would mean incorrectly decoded data.

What about schema evolution? When an application wants to encode some data, it encodes the data using whatever version of the schema it knows (_writer's schema_).

When an application wants to decode some data, it is expecting the data to be in some schema (_reader's schema_).

In Avro the writer's schema and the reader's schema _don't have to be the same_. The Avro library resolves the differences by looking at the writer's schema and the reader's schema.

Forward compatibility means you can have a new version of the schema as writer and an old version of the schema as reader. Conversely, backward compatibility means that you can have a new version of the schema as reader and an old version as writer.

To maintain compatibility, you may only add or remove a field that has a default value.

If you were to add a field that has no default value, new readers wouldn't be able to read data written by old writers.

Changing the datatype of a field is possible, provided that Avro can convert the type. Changing the name of a filed is tricky (backward compatible but not forward compatible).

The schema is identified encoded in the data. In a large file with lots of records, the writer of the file can just include the schema at the beginning of the file. On a database with individually written records, you cannot assume all the records will have the same schema, so you have to include a version number at the beginning of every encoded record. While sending records over the network, you can negotiate the schema version on connection setup.

Avro is friendlier to _dynamically generated schemas_ (dumping into a file the database). You can fairly easily generate an Avro schema in JSON.

If the database schema changes, you can just generate a new Avro schema for the updated database schema and export data in the new Avro schema.

By contrast with Thrift and Protocol Buffers, every time the database schema changes, you would have to manually update the mappings from database column names to field tags.

---

Although textual formats such as JSON, XML and CSV are widespread, binary encodings based on schemas are also a viable option. As they have nice properties:
* Can be much more compact, since they can omit field names from the encoded data.
* Schema is a valuable form of documentation, required for decoding, you can be sure it is up to date.
* Database of schemas allows you to check forward and backward compatibility changes.
* Generate code from the schema is useful, since it enables type checking at compile time.

### Modes of dataflow

Different process on how data flows between processes

#### Via databases

The process that writes to the database encodes the data, and the process that reads from the database decodes it.

A value in the database may be written by a _newer_ version of the code, and subsequently read by an _older_ version of the code that is still running.

When a new version of your application is deployed, you may entirely replace the old version with the new version within a few minutes. The same is not true in databases, the five-year-old data will still be there, in the original encoding, unless you have explicitly rewritten it. _Data outlives code_.

Rewriting (_migrating_) is expensive, most relational databases allow simple schema changes, such as adding a new column with a `null` default value without rewriting existing data. When an old row is read, the database fills in `null`s for any columns that are missing.

#### Via service calls

You have processes that need to communicate over a network of _clients_ and _servers_.

Services are similar to databases, each service should be owned by one team. and that team should be able to release versions of the service frequently, without having to coordinate with other teams. We should expect old and new versions of servers and clients to be running at the same time.

_Remote procedure calls_ (RPC) tries to make a request to a remote network service look the same as calling a function or method in your programming language, it seems convenient at first but the approach is flawed:
* A network request is unpredictable
* A network request it may return without a result, due a _timeout_
* Retrying will cause the action to be performed multiple times, unless you build a mechanism for deduplication (_idempotence_).
* A network request is much slower than a function call, and its latency is wildly variable.
* Parameters need to be encoded into a sequence of bytes that can be sent over the network and becomes problematic with larger objects.
* The RPC framework must translate datatypes from one language to another, not all languages have the same types.

**There is no point trying to make a remote service look too much like a local object in your programming language, because it's a fundamentally different thing.**

New generation of RPC frameworks are more explicit about the fact that a remote request is different from a local function call. Fiangle and Rest.li use _features_ (_promises_) to encapsulate asyncrhonous actions.

RESTful API has some significant advantages like being good for experimentation and debugging.

REST seems to be the predominant style for public APIs. The main focus of RPC frameworks is on requests between services owned by the same organisation, typically within the same datacenter.

#### Via asynchronous message passing

In an _asynchronous message-passing_ systems, a client's request (usually called a _message_) is delivered to another process with low latency. The message goes via an intermediary called a _message broker_ (_message queue_ or _message-oriented middleware_) which stores the message temporarily. This has several advantages compared to direct RPC:
* It can act as a buffer if the recipient is unavailable or overloaded
* It can automatically redeliver messages to a process that has crashed and prevent messages from being lost
* It avoids the sender needing to know the IP address and port number of the recipient (useful in a cloud environment)
* It allows one message to be sent to several recipients
* **Decouples the sender from the recipient**

The communication happens only in one direction. The sender doesn't wait for the message to be delivered, but simply sends it and then forgets about it (_asynchronous_).

Open source implementations for message brokers are RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, HornetQ, NATS, and Apache Kafka.

One process sends a message to a named _queue_ or _topic_ and the broker ensures that the message is delivered to one or more _consumers_ or _subscribers_ to that queue or topic.

Message brokers typically don't enforce a particular data model, you can use any encoding format.

An _actor model_ is a programming model for concurrency in a single process. Rather than dealing with threads (and their complications), logic is encapsulated in _actors_. Each actor typically represent one client or entity, it may have some local state, and it communicates with other actors by sending and receiving asynchronous messages. Message deliver is not guaranteed. Since each actor processes only one message at a time, it doesn't need to worry about threads.

In _distributed actor frameworks_, this programming model is used to scale an application across multiple nodes. It basically integrates a message broker and the actor model into a single framework.

* _Akka_ uses Java's built-in serialisation by default, which does not provide forward or backward compatibility. You can replace it with something like Protocol Buffers and the ability to do rolling upgrades.
* _Orleans_ by default uses custom data encoding format that does not support rolling upgrade deployments.
* In _Erlang OTP_ it is surprisingly hard to make changes to record schemas.

What happens if multiple machines are involved in storage and retrieval of data?

Reasons for distribute a database across multiple machines:
* Scalability
* Fault tolerance/high availability
* Latency, having servers at various locations worldwide

## Replication

Reasons why you might want to replicate data:
* To keep data geographically close to your users
* Increase availability
* Increase read throughput

The difficulty in replication lies in handling _changes_ to replicated data. Popular algorithms for replicating changes between nodes: _single-leader_, _multi-leader_, and _leaderless_ replication.

### Leaders and followers

Each node that stores a copy of the database is called a _replica_.

Every write to the database needs to be processed by every replica. The most common solution for this is called _leader-based replication_ (_active/passive_ or _master-slave replication_).
1. One of the replicas is designated the _leader_ (_master_ or _primary_). Writes to the database must send requests to the leader.
2. Other replicas are known as _followers_ (_read replicas_, _slaves_, _secondaries_ or _hot stanbys_). The leader sends the data change to all of its followers as part of a _replication log_ or _change stream_.
3. Reads can be query the leader or any of the followers, while writes are only accepted on the leader.

MySQL, Oracle Data Guard, SQL Server's AlwaysOn Availability Groups, MongoDB, RethinkDB, Espresso, Kafka and RabbitMQ are examples of these kind of databases.

#### Synchronous vs asynchronous

**The advantage of synchronous replication is that the follower is guaranteed to have an up-to-date copy of the data that is consistent with the leader. The disadvantage is that it the synchronous follower doesn't respond, the write cannot be processed.**

It's impractical for all followers to be synchronous. If you enable synchronous replication on a database, it usually means that _one_ of the followers is synchronous, and the others are asynchronous. This guarantees up-to-date copy of the data on at least two nodes (this is sometimes called _semi-synchronous_).

Often, leader-based replication is asynchronous. Writes are not guaranteed to be durable, the main advantage of this approach is that the leader can continue processing writes.

#### Setting up new followers

Copying data files from one node to another is typically not sufficient.

Setting up a follower can usually be done without downtime. The process looks like:
1. Take a snapshot of the leader's database
2. Copy the snapshot to the follower node
3. Follower requests data changes that have happened since the snapshot was taken
4. Once follower processed the backlog of data changes since snapshot, it has _caught up_.

#### Handling node outages

How does high availability works with leader-based replication?

#### Follower failure: catchup recovery

Follower can connect to the leader and request all the data changes that occurred during the time when the follower was disconnected.

#### Leader failure: failover

One of the followers needs to be promoted to be the new leader, clients need to be reconfigured to send their writes to the new leader and followers need to start consuming data changes from the new leader.

Automatic failover consists:
1. Determining that the leader has failed. If a node does not respond in a period of time it's considered dead.
2. Choosing a new leader. The best candidate for leadership is usually the replica with the most up-to-date changes from the old leader.
3. Reconfiguring the system to use the new leader. The system needs to ensure that the old leader becomes a follower and recognises the new leader.

Things that could go wrong:
* If asynchronous replication is used, the new leader may have received conflicting writes in the meantime.
* Discarding writes is especially dangerous if other storage systems outside of the database need to be coordinated with the database contents.
* It could happen that two nodes both believe that they are the leader (_split brain_). Data is likely to be lost or corrupted.
* What is the right time before the leader is declared dead?

For these reasons, some operation teams prefer to perform failovers manually, even if the software supports automatic failover.

#### Implementation of replication logs

##### Statement-based replication

The leader logs every _statement_ and sends it to its followers (every `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE`).

This type of replication has some problems:
* Non-deterministic functions such as `NOW()` or `RAND()` will generate different values on replicas.
* Statements that depend on existing data, like auto-increments, must be executed in the same order in each replica.
* Statements with side effects may result on different results on each replica.

A solution to this is to replace any nondeterministic function with a fixed return value in the leader.

##### Write-ahead log (WAL) shipping

The log is an append-only sequence of bytes containing all writes to the database. The leader can send it to its followers. This way of replication is used in PostgresSQL and Oracle.

The main disadvantage is that the log describes the data at a very low level (like which bytes were changed in which disk blocks), coupling it to the storage engine.

Usually is not possible to run different versions of the database in leaders and followers. This can have a big operational impact, like making it impossible to have a zero-downtime upgrade of the database.

##### Logical (row-based) log replication

Basically a sequence of records describing writes to database tables at the granularity of a row:
* For an inserted row, the new values of all columns.
* For a deleted row, the information that uniquely identifies that column.
* For an updated row, the information to uniquely identify that row and all the new values of the columns.

A transaction that modifies several rows, generates several of such logs, followed by a record indicating that the transaction was committed. MySQL binlog uses this approach.

Since logical log is decoupled from the storage engine internals, it's easier to make it backwards compatible.

Logical logs are also easier for external applications to parse, useful for data warehouses, custom indexes and caches (_change data capture_).

##### Trigger-based replication

There are some situations were you may need to move replication up to the application layer.

A trigger lets you register custom application code that is automatically executed when a data change occurs. This is a good opportunity to log this change into a separate table, from which it can be read by an external process.

Main disadvantages is that this approach has greater overheads, is more prone to bugs but it may be useful due to its flexibility.

### Problems with replication lag

Node failures is just one reason for wanting replication. Other reasons are scalability and latency.

In a _read-scaling_ architecture, you can increase the capacity for serving read-only requests simply by adding more followers. However, this only realistically works on asynchronous replication. The more nodes you have, the likelier is that one will be down, so a fully synchronous configuration would be unreliable.

With an asynchronous approach, a follower may fall behind, leading to inconsistencies in the database (_eventual consistency_).

The _replication lag_ could be a fraction of a second or several seconds or even minutes.

The problems that may arise and how to solve them.

#### Reading your own writes

_Read-after-write consistency_, also known as _read-your-writes consistency_ is a guarantee that if the user reloads the page, they will always see any updates they submitted themselves.

How to implement it:
* **When reading something that the user may have modified, read it from the leader.** For example, user profile information on a social network is normally only editable by the owner. A simple rule is always read the user's own profile from the leader.
* You could track the time of the latest update and, for one minute after the last update, make all reads from the leader.
* The client can remember the timestamp of the most recent write, then the system can ensure that the replica serving any reads for that user reflects updates at least until that timestamp.
* If your replicas are distributed across multiple datacenters, then any request needs to be routed to the datacenter that contains the leader.


Another complication is that the same user is accessing your service from multiple devices, you may want to provide _cross-device_ read-after-write consistency.

Some additional issues to consider:
* Remembering the timestamp of the user's last update becomes more difficult. The metadata will need to be centralised.
* If replicas are distributed across datacenters, there is no guarantee that connections from different devices will be routed to the same datacenter. You may need to route requests from all of a user's devices to the same datacenter.

#### Monotonic reads

Because of followers falling behind, it's possible for a user to see things _moving backward in time_.

When you read data, you may see an old value; monotonic reads only means that if one user makes several reads in sequence, they will not see time go backward.

Make sure that each user always makes their reads from the same replica. The replica can be chosen based on a hash of the user ID. If the replica fails, the user's queries will need to be rerouted to another replica.

#### Consistent prefix reads

If a sequence of writes happens in a certain order, then anyone reading those writes will see them appear in the same order.

This is a particular problem in partitioned (sharded) databases as there is no global ordering of writes.

A solution is to make sure any writes casually related to each other are written to the same partition.

#### Solutions for replication lag

_Transactions_ exist so there is a way for a database to provide stronger guarantees so that the application can be simpler.

### Multi-leader replication

Leader-based replication has one major downside: there is only one leader, and all writes must go through it.

A natural extension is to allow more than one node to accept writes (_multi-leader_, _master-master_ or _active/active_ replication) where each leader simultaneously acts as a follower to the other leaders.

#### Use cases for multi-leader replication

It rarely makes sense to use multi-leader setup within a single datacenter.

##### Multi-datacenter operation

You can have a leader in _each_ datacenter. Within each datacenter, regular leader-follower replication is used. Between datacenters, each datacenter leader replicates its changes to the leaders in other datacenters.

Compared to a single-leader replication model deployed in multi-datacenters
* **Performance.** With single-leader, every write must go across the internet to wherever the leader is, adding significant latency. In multi-leader every write is processed in the local datacenter and replicated asynchronously to other datacenters. The network delay is hidden from users and perceived performance may be better.
* **Tolerance of datacenter outages.** In single-leader if the datacenter with the leader fails, failover can promote a follower in another datacenter. In multi-leader, each datacenter can continue operating independently from others.
* **Tolerance of network problems.** Single-leader is very sensitive to problems in this inter-datacenter link as writes are made synchronously over this link. Multi-leader with asynchronous replication can tolerate network problems better.

Multi-leader replication is implemented with Tungsten Replicator for MySQL, BDR for PostgreSQL or GoldenGate for Oracle.

It's common to fall on subtle configuration pitfalls. Autoincrementing keys, triggers and integrity constraints can be problematic. Multi-leader replication is often considered dangerous territory and avoided if possible.

##### Clients with offline operation

If you have an application that needs to continue to work while it is disconnected from the internet, every device that has a local database can act as a leader, and there will be some asynchronous multi-leader replication process (imagine, a Calendar application).

CouchDB is designed for this mode of operation.

#### Collaborative editing

_Real-time collaborative editing_ applications allow several people to edit a document simultaneously. Like Etherpad or Google Docs.

The user edits a document, the changes are instantly applied to their local replica and asynchronously replicated to the server and any other user.

If you want to avoid editing conflicts, you must the lock the document before a user can edit it.

For faster collaboration, you may want to make the unit of change very small (like a keystroke) and avoid locking.

#### Handling write conflicts

The biggest problem with multi-leader replication is when conflict resolution is required. This problem does not happen in a single-leader database.

##### Synchronous vs asynchronous conflict detection

In single-leader the second writer can be blocked and wait the first one to complete, forcing the user to retry the write. On multi-leader if both writes are successful, the conflict is only detected asynchronously later in time.

If you want synchronous conflict detection, you might as well use single-leader replication.

##### Conflict avoidance

The simplest strategy for dealing with conflicts is to avoid them. If all writes for a particular record go through the sae leader, then conflicts cannot occur.

On an application where a user can edit their own data, you can ensure that requests from a particular user are always routed to the same datacenter and use the leader in that datacenter for reading and writing.

##### Converging toward a consistent state

On single-leader, the last write determines the final value of the field.

In multi-leader, it's not clear what the final value should be.

The database must resolve the conflict in a _convergent_ way, all replicas must arrive a the same final value when all changes have been replicated.

Different ways of achieving convergent conflict resolution.
* Five each write a unique ID (timestamp, long random number, UUID, or a has of the key and value), pick the write with the highest ID as the _winner_ and throw away the other writes. This is known as _last write wins_ (LWW) and it is dangerously prone to data loss.
* Give each replica a unique ID, writes that originated at a higher-numbered replica always take precedence. This approach also implies data loss.
* Somehow merge the values together.
* Record the conflict and write application code that resolves it a to some later time (perhaps prompting the user).

##### Custom conflict resolution

Multi-leader replication tools let you write conflict resolution logic using application code.

* **On write.** As soon as the database system detects a conflict in the log of replicated changes, it calls the conflict handler.
* **On read.** All the conflicting writes are stored. On read, multiple versions of the data are returned to the application. The application may prompt the user or automatically resolve the conflict. CouchDB works this way.

#### Multi-leader replication topologies

A _replication topology_ describes the communication paths along which writes are propagated from one node to another.

The most general topology is _all-to-all_ in which every leader sends its writes to every other leader. MySQL uses _circular topology_, where each nodes receives writes from one node and forwards those writes to another node. Another popular topology has the shape of a _star_, one designated node forwards writes to all of the other nodes.

In circular and star topologies a write might need to pass through multiple nodes before they reach all replicas. To prevent infinite replication loops each node is given a unique identifier and the replication log tags each write with the identifiers of the nodes it has passed through. When a node fails it can interrupt the flow of replication messages.

In all-to-all topology fault tolerance is better as messages can travel along different paths avoiding a single point of failure. It has some issues too, some network links may be faster than others and some replication messages may "overtake" others. To order events correctly. there is a technique called _version vectors_. PostgresSQL BDR does not provide casual ordering of writes, and Tungsten Replicator for MySQL doesn't even try to detect conflicts.

### Leaderless replication

Simply put, any replica can directly accept writes from clients. Databases like look like Amazon's in-house _Dynamo_ datastore. _Riak_, _Cassandra_ and _Voldemort_ follow the _Dynamo style_.

In a leaderless configuration, failover does not exist. Clients send the write to all replicas in parallel.

_Read requests are also sent to several nodes in parallel_. The client may get different responses. Version numbers are used to determine which value is newer.

Eventually, all the data is copied to every replica. After a unavailable node come back online, it has two different mechanisms to catch up:
* **Read repair.** When a client detect any stale responses, write the newer value back to that replica.
* **Anti-entropy process.** There is a background process that constantly looks for differences in data between replicas and copies any missing data from one replica to he other. It does not copy writes in any particular order.

#### Quorums for reading and writing

If there are _n_ replicas, every write must be confirmed by _w_ nodes to be considered successful, and we must query at least _r_ nodes for each read. As long as _w_ + _r_ > _n_, we expect to get an up-to-date value when reading. _r_ and _w_ values are called _quorum_ reads and writes. Are the minimum number of votes required for the read or write to be valid.

A common choice is to make _n_ and odd number (typically 3 or 5) and to set _w_ = _r_ = (_n_ + 1)/2 (rounded up).

Limitations:
* Sloppy quorum, the _w_ writes may end up on different nodes than the _r_ reads, so there is no longer a guaranteed overlap.
* If two writes occur concurrently, and is not clear which one happened first, the only safe solution is to merge them. Writes can be lost due to clock skew.
* If a write happens concurrently with a read, the write may be reflected on only some of the replicas.
* If a write succeeded on some replicas but failed on others, it is not rolled back on the replicas where it succeeded. Reads may or may not return the value from that write.
* If a node carrying a new value fails, and its data is restored from a replica carrying an old value, the number of replicas storing the new value may break the quorum condition.

**Dynamo-style databases are generally optimised for use cases that can tolerate eventual consistency.**

#### Sloppy quorums and hinted handoff

Leaderless replication may be appealing for use cases that require high availability and low latency, and that can tolerate occasional stale reads.

It's likely that the client won't be able to connect to _some_ database nodes during a network interruption.
* Is it better to return errors to all requests for which we cannot reach quorum of _w_ or _r_ nodes?
* Or should we accept writes anyway, and write them to some nodes that are reachable but aren't among the _n_ nodes on which the value usually lives?

The latter is known as _sloppy quorum_: writes and reads still require _w_ and _r_ successful responses, but those may include nodes that are not among the designated _n_ "home" nodes for a value.

Once the network interruption is fixed, any writes are sent to the appropriate "home" nodes (_hinted handoff_).

Sloppy quorums are useful for increasing write availability: as long as any _w_ nodes are available, the database can accept writes. This also means that you cannot be sure to read the latest value for a key, because it may have been temporarily written to some nodes outside of _n_.

##### Multi-datacenter operation

Each write from a client is sent to all replicas, regardless of datacenter, but the client usually only waits for acknowledgement from a quorum of nodes within its local datacenter so that it is unaffected by delays and interruptions on cross-datacenter link.

#### Detecting concurrent writes

In order to become eventually consistent, the replicas should converge toward the same value. If you want to avoid losing data, you application developer, need to know a lot about the internals of your database's conflict handling.

* **Last write wins (discarding concurrent writes).** Even though the writes don' have a natural ordering, we can force an arbitrary order on them. We can attach a timestamp to each write and pick the most recent. There are some situations such caching on which lost writes are acceptable. If losing data is not acceptable, LWW is a poor choice for conflict resolution.
* **The "happens-before" relationship and concurrency.** Whether one operation happens before another operation is the key to defining what concurrency means. **We can simply say that to operations are _concurrent_ if neither happens before the other.** Either A happened before B, or B happened before A, or A and B are concurrent.

##### Capturing the happens-before relationship

The server can determine whether two operations are concurrent by looking at the version numbers.
* The server maintains a version number for every key, increments the version number every time that key is written, and stores the new version number along the value written.
* Client reads a key, the server returns all values that have not been overwrite, as well as the latest version number. A client must read a key before writing.
* Client writes a key, it must include the version number from the prior read, and it must merge together all values that it received in the prior read.
* Server receives a write with a particular version number, it can overwrite all values with that version number or below, but it must keep all values with a higher version number.

##### Merging concurrently written values

No data is silently dropped. It requires clients do some extra work, they have to clean up afterward by merging the concurrently written values. Riak calls these concurrent values _siblings_.

Merging sibling values is the same problem as conflict resolution in multi-leader replication. A simple approach is to just pick one of the values on a version number or timestamp (last write wins). You may need to do something more intelligent in application code to avoid losing data.

If you want to allow people to _remove_ things, union of siblings may not yield the right result. An item cannot simply be deleted from the database when it is removed, the system must leave a marker with an appropriate version number to indicate that the item has been removed when merging siblings (_tombstone_).

Merging siblings in application code is complex and error-prone, there are efforts to design data structures that can perform this merging automatically (CRDTs).

#### Version vectors

We need a version number _per replica_ as well as per key. Each replica increments its own version number when processing a write, and also keeps track of the version numbers it has seen from each of the other replicas.

The collection of version numbers from all the replicas is called a _version vector_.

Version vector are sent from the database replicas to clients when values are read, and need to be sent back to the database when a value is subsequently written. Riak calls this _casual context_. Version vectors allow the database to distinguish between overwrites and concurrent writes.

## Partitioning

Replication, for very large datasets or very high query throughput is not sufficient, we need to break the data up into _partitions_ (_sharding_).

Basically, each partition is a small database of its own.

The main reason for wanting to partition data is _scalability_, query load can be load cabe distributed across many processors. Throughput can be scaled by adding more nodes.


### Partitioning and replication

Each record belongs to exactly one partition, it may still be stored on several nodes for fault tolerance.

A node may store more than one partition.

### Partition of key-value data

Our goal with partitioning is to spread the data and the query load evenly across nodes.

If partition is unfair, we call it _skewed_. It makes partitioning much less effective. A partition with disproportionately high load is called a _hot spot_.

The simplest approach is to assign records to nodes randomly. The main disadvantage is that if you are trying to read a particular item, you have no way of knowing which node it is on, so you have to query all nodes in parallel.

#### Partition by key range

Assign a continuous range of keys, like the volumes of a paper encyclopaedia. Boundaries might be chose manually by an administrator, or the database can choose them automatically. On each partition, keys are in sorted order so scans are easy.

The downside is that certain access patterns can lead to hot spots.

#### Partitioning by hash of key

A good hash function takes skewed data and makes it uniformly distributed. There is no need to be cryptographically strong (MongoDB uses MD5 and Cassandra uses Murmur3). You can assign each partition a range of hashes. The boundaries can be evenly spaced or they can be chosen pseudorandomly (_consistent hashing_).

Unfortunately we lose the ability to do efficient range queries. Keys that were once adjacent are now scattered across all the partitions. Any range query has to be sent to all partitions.

#### Skewed workloads and relieving hot spots

You can't avoid hot spots entirely. For example, you may end up with large volume of writes to the same key.

It's the responsibility of the application to reduce the skew. A simple technique is to add a random number to the beginning or end of the key.

Splitting writes across different keys, makes reads now to do some extra work and combine them.

### Partitioning and secondary indexes

The situation gets more complicated if secondary indexes are involved. A secondary index usually doesn't identify the record uniquely. They don't map neatly to partitions.

#### Partitioning secondary indexes by document

Each partition maintains its secondary indexes, covering only the documents in that partition (_local index_).

You need to send the query to _all_ partitions, and combine all the results you get back (_scatter/gather_). This is prone to tail latency amplification and is widely used in MongoDB, Riak, Cassandra, Elasticsearch, SolrCloud and VoltDB.

#### Partitioning secondary indexes by term

We construct a _global index_ that covers data in all partitions. The global index must also be partitioned so it doesn't become the bottleneck.

It is called the _term-partitioned_ because the term we're looking for determines the partition of the index.

Partitioning by term can be useful for range scans, whereas partitioning on a hash of the term gives a more even distribution load.

The advantage is that it can make reads more efficient: rather than doing scatter/gather over all partitions, a client only needs to make a request to the partition containing the term that it wants. The downside of a global index is that writes are slower and complicated.

### Rebalancing partitions

The process of moving load from one node in the cluster to another.

Strategies for rebalancing:
* **How not to do it: Hash mod n.** The problem with _mod N_ is that if the number of nodes _N_ changes, most of the keys will need to be moved from one node to another.
* **Fixed number of partitions.** Create many more partitions than there are nodes and assign several partitions to each node. If a node is added to the cluster, we can _steal_ a few partitions from every existing node until partitions are fairly distributed once again. The number of partitions does not change, nor does the assignment of keys to partitions. The only thing that change is the assignment of partitions to nodes. This is used in Riak, Elasticsearch, Couchbase, and Voldemport. **You need to choose a high enough number of partitions to accomodate future growth.** Neither too big or too small.
* **Dynamic partitioning.** The number of partitions adapts to the total data volume. An empty database starts with an empty partition. While the dataset is small, all writes have to processed by a single node while the others nodes sit idle. HBase and MongoDB allow an initial set of partitions to be configured (_pre-splitting_).
* **Partitioning proportionally to nodes.** Cassandra and Ketama make the number of partitions proportional to the number of nodes. Have a fixed number of partitions _per node_. This approach also keeps the size of each partition fairly stable.

#### Automatic versus manual rebalancing

Fully automated rebalancing may seem convenient but the process can overload the network or the nodes and harm the performance of other requests while the rebalancing is in progress.

It can be good to have a human in the loop for rebalancing. You may avoid operational surprises.

### Request routing

This problem is also called _service discovery_. There are different approaches:
1. Allow clients to contact any node and make them handle the request directly, or forward the request to the appropriate node.
2. Send all requests from clients to a routing tier first that acts as a partition-aware load balancer.
3. Make clients aware of the partitioning and the assignment of partitions to nodes.

In many cases the problem is: how does the component making the routing decision learn about changes in the assignment of partitions to nodes?

Many distributed data systems rely on a separate coordination service such as ZooKeeper to keep track of this cluster metadata. Each node registers itself in ZooKeeper, and ZooKeeper maintains the authoritative mapping of partitions to nodes. The routing tier or the partitioning-aware client, can subscribe to this information in ZooKeeper. HBase, SolrCloud and Kafka use ZooKeeper to track partition assignment. MongoDB relies on its own _config server_. Cassandra and Riak take a different approach: they use a _gossip protocol_.

#### Parallel query execution

_Massively parallel processing_ (MPP) relational database products are much more sophisticated in the types of queries they support.

## Transactions

Implementing fault-tolerant mechanisms is a lot of work.

_Transactions_ have been the mechanism of choice for simplifying these issues. Conceptually, all the reads and writes in a transaction are executed as one operation: either the entire transaction succeeds (_commit_) or it fails (_abort_, _rollback_).

The application is free to ignore certain potential error scenarios and concurrency issues (_safety guarantees_).

#### ACID

* **Atomicity.** Is _not_ about concurrency. It is what happens if a client wants to make several writes, but a fault occurs after some of the writes have been processed. _Abortability_ would have been a better term than _atomicity_.
* **Consistency.** _Invariants_ on your data must always be true. The idea of consistency depends on the application's notion of invariants. Atomicity, isolation, and durability are properties of the database, whereas consistency (in an ACID sense) is a property of the application.
* **Isolation.** Concurrently executing transactions are isolated from each other. It's also called _serializability_, each transaction can pretend that it is the only transaction running on the entire database, and the result is the same as if they had run _serially_ (one after the other).
* **Durability.** Once a transaction has committed successfully, any data it has written will not be forgotten, even if there is a hardware fault or the database crashes. In a single-node database this means the data has been written to nonvolatile storage. In a replicated database it means the data has been successfully copied to some number of nodes.

Atomicity can be implemented using a log for crash recovery, and isolation can be implemented using a lock on each object, allowing only one thread to access an object at any one time.

**A transaction is a mechanism for grouping multiple operations on multiple objects into one unit of execution.**

#### Handling errors and aborts

A key feature of a transaction is that it can be aborted and safely retried if an error occurred.

In datastores with leaderless replication is the application's responsibility to recover from errors.

The whole point of aborts is to enable safe retries.

### Weak isolation levels

Concurrency issues (race conditions) come into play when one transaction reads data that is concurrently modified by another transaction, or when two transactions try to simultaneously modify the same data.

Databases have long tried to hide concurrency issues by providing _transaction isolation_.

In practice, is not that simple. Serializable isolation has a performance cost. It's common for systems to use weaker levels of isolation, which protect against _some_ concurrency issues, but not all.

Weak isolation levels used in practice:

#### Read committed

It makes two guarantees:
1. When reading from the database, you will only see data that has been committed (no _dirty reads_). Writes by a transaction only become visible to others when that transaction commits.
2. When writing to the database, you will only overwrite data that has been committed (no _dirty writes_). Dirty writes are prevented usually by delaying the second write until the first write's transaction has committed or aborted.

Most databases prevent dirty writes by using row-level locks that hold the lock until the transaction is committed or aborted. Only one transaction can hold the lock for any given object.

On dirty reads, requiring read locks does not work well in practice as one long-running write transaction can force many read-only transactions to wait. For every object that is written, the database remembers both the old committed value and the new value set by the transaction that currently holds the write lock. While the transaction is ongoing, any other transactions that read the object are simply given the old value.

#### Snapshot isolation and repeatable read

There are still plenty of ways in which you can have concurrency bugs when using this isolation level.

_Nonrepeatable read_ or _read skew_, when you read at the same time you committed a change you may see temporal and inconsistent results.

There are some situations that cannot tolerate such temporal inconsistencies:
* **Backups.** During the time that the backup process is running, writes will continue to be made to the database. If you need to restore from such a backup, inconsistencies can become permanent.
* **Analytic queries and integrity checks.** You may get nonsensical results if they observe parts of the database at different points in time.

_Snapshot isolation_ is the most common solution. Each transaction reads from a _consistent snapshot_ of the database.

The implementation of snapshots typically use write locks to prevent dirty writes.

The database must potentially keep several different committed versions of an object (_multi-version concurrency control_ or MVCC).

Read committed uses a separate snapshot for each query, while snapshot isolation uses the same snapshot for an entire transaction.

How do indexes work in a multi-version database? One option is to have the index simply point to all versions of an object and require an index query to filter out any object versions that are not visible to the current transaction.

Snapshot isolation is called _serializable_ in Oracle, and _repeatable read_ in PostgreSQL and MySQL.

#### Preventing lost updates

This might happen if an application reads some value from the database, modifies it, and writes it back. If two transactions do this concurrently, one of the modifications can be lost (later write _clobbers_ the earlier write).

##### Atomic write operations

A solution for this it to avoid the need to implement read-modify-write cycles and provide atomic operations such us

```sql
UPDATE counters SET value = value + 1 WHERE key = 'foo';
```

MongoDB provides atomic operations for making local modifications, and Redis provides atomic operations for modifying data structures.

##### Explicit locking

The application explicitly lock objects that are going to be updated.

##### Automatically detecting lost updates

Allow them to execute in parallel, if the transaction manager detects a lost update, abort the transaction and force it to retry its read-modify-write cycle.

MySQL/InnoDB's repeatable read does not detect lost updates.

##### Compare-and-set

If the current value does not match with what you previously read, the update has no effect.

```SQL
UPDATE wiki_pages SET content = 'new content'
  WHERE id = 1234 AND content = 'old content';
```

##### Conflict resolution and replication

With multi-leader or leaderless replication, compare-and-set do not apply.

A common approach in replicated databases is to allow concurrent writes to create several conflicting versions of a value (also know as _siblings_), and to use application code or special data structures to resolve and merge these versions after the fact.

#### Write skew and phantoms

Imagine Alice and Bob are two on-call doctors for a particular shift. Imagine both the request to leave because they are feeling unwell. Unfortunately they happen to click the button to go off call at approximately the same time.

    ALICE                                   BOB

    ┌─ BEGIN TRANSACTION                    ┌─ BEGIN TRANSACTION
    │                                       │
    ├─ currently_on_call = (                ├─ currently_on_call = (
    │   select count(*) from doctors        │    select count(*) from doctors
    │   where on_call = true                │    where on_call = true
    │   and shift_id = 1234                 │    and shift_id = 1234
    │  )                                    │  )
    │  // now currently_on_call = 2         │  // now currently_on_call = 2
    │                                       │
    ├─ if (currently_on_call  2) {          │
    │    update doctors                     │
    │    set on_call = false                │
    │    where name = 'Alice'               │
    │    and shift_id = 1234                ├─ if (currently_on_call >= 2) {
    │  }                                    │    update doctors
    │                                       │    set on_call = false
    └─ COMMIT TRANSACTION                   │    where name = 'Bob'  
                                            │    and shift_id = 1234
                                            │  }
                                            │
                                            └─ COMMIT TRANSACTION

Since database is using snapshot isolation, both checks return 2. Both transactions commit, and now no doctor is on call. The requirement of having at least one doctor has been violated.

Write skew can occur if two transactions read the same objects, and then update some of those objects. You get a dirty write or lost update anomaly.

Ways to prevent write skew are a bit more restricted:
* Atomic operations don't help as things involve more objects.
* Automatically prevent write skew requires true serializable isolation.
* The second-best option in this case is probably to explicitly lock the rows that the transaction depends on.
  ```sql
  BEGIN TRANSACTION;

  SELECT * FROM doctors
  WHERE on_call = true
  AND shift_id = 1234 FOR UPDATE;

  UPDATE doctors
  SET on_call = false
  WHERE name = 'Alice'
  AND shift_id = 1234;

  COMMIT;
  ```

### Serializability

This is the strongest isolation level. It guarantees that even though transactions may execute in parallel, the end result is the same as if they had executed one at a time, _serially_, without concurrency. Basically, the database prevents _all_ possible race conditions.

There are three techniques for achieving this:
* Executing transactions in serial order
* Two-phase locking
* Serializable snapshot isolation.

#### Actual serial execution

The simplest way of removing concurrency problems is to remove concurrency entirely and execute only one transaction at a time, in serial order, on a single thread. This approach is implemented by VoltDB/H-Store, Redis and Datomic.

##### Encapsulating transactions in stored procedures

With interactive style of transaction, a lot of time is spent in network communication between the application and the database.

For this reason, systems with single-threaded serial transaction processing don't allow interactive multi-statement transactions. The application must submit the entire transaction code to the database ahead of time, as a _stored procedure_, so all the data required by the transaction is in memory and the procedure can execute very fast.

There are a few pros and cons for stored procedures:
* Each database vendor has its own language for stored procedures. They usually look quite ugly and archaic from today's point of view, and they lack the ecosystem of libraries.
* It's harder to debug, more awkward to keep in version control and deploy, trickier to test, and difficult to integrate with monitoring.

Modern implementations of stored procedures include general-purpose programming languages instead: VoltDB uses Java or Groovy, Datomic uses Java or Clojure, and Redis uses Lua.

##### Partitioning

Executing all transactions serially limits the transaction throughput to the speed of a single CPU.

In order to scale to multiple CPU cores you can potentially partition your data and each partition can have its own transaction processing thread. You can give each CPU core its own partition.

For any transaction that needs to access multiple partitions, the database must coordinate the transaction across all the partitions. They will be vastly slower than single-partition transactions.

#### Two-phase locking (2PL)

> Two-phase locking (2PL) sounds similar to two-phase _commit_ (2PC) but be aware that they are completely different things.

Several transactions are allowed to concurrently read the same object as long as nobody is writing it. When somebody wants to write (modify or delete) an object, exclusive access is required.

Writers don't just block other writers; they also block readers and vice versa. It protects against all the race conditions discussed earlier.

Blocking readers and writers is implemented by a having lock on each object in the database. The lock is used as follows:
* if a transaction want sot read an object, it must first acquire a lock in shared mode.
* If a transaction wants to write to an object, it must first acquire the lock in exclusive mode.
* If a transaction first reads and then writes an object, it may upgrade its shared lock to an exclusive lock.
* After a transaction has acquired the lock, it must continue to hold the lock until the end of the transaction (commit or abort). **First phase is when the locks are acquired, second phase is when all the locks are released.**

It can happen that transaction A is stuck waiting for transaction B to release its lock, and vice versa (_deadlock_).

**The performance for transaction throughput and response time of queries are significantly worse under two-phase locking than under weak isolation.**

A transaction may have to wait for several others to complete before it can do anything.

Databases running 2PL can have unstable latencies, and they can be very slow at high percentiles. One slow transaction, or one transaction that accesses a lot of data and acquires many locks can cause the rest of the system to halt.

##### Predicate locks

With _phantoms_, one transaction may change the results of another transaction's search query.

In order to prevent phantoms, we need a _predicate lock_. Rather than a lock belonging to a particular object, it belongs to all objects that match some search condition.

Predicate locks applies even to objects that do not yet exist in the database, but which might be added in the future (phantoms).

##### Index-range locks

Predicate locks do not perform well. Checking for matching locks becomes time-consuming and for that reason most databases implement _index-range locking_.

It's safe to simplify a predicate by making it match a greater set of objects.

These locks are not as precise as predicate locks would be, but since they have much lower overheads, they are a good compromise.

#### Serializable snapshot isolation (SSI)

It provides full serializability and has a small performance penalty compared to snapshot isolation. SSI is fairly new and might become the new default in the future.

##### Pesimistic versus optimistic concurrency control

Two-phase locking is called _pessimistic_ concurrency control because if anything might possibly go wrong, it's better to wait.

Serial execution is also _pessimistic_ as is equivalent to each transaction having an exclusive lock on the entire database.

Serializable snapshot isolation is _optimistic_ concurrency control technique. Instead of blocking if something potentially dangerous happens, transactions continue anyway, in the hope that everything will turn out all right. The database is responsible for checking whether anything bad happened. If so, the transaction is aborted and has to be retried.

If there is enough spare capacity, and if contention between transactions is not too high, optimistic concurrency control techniques tend to perform better than pessimistic ones.

SSI is based on snapshot isolation, reads within a transaction are made from a consistent snapshot of the database. On top of snapshot isolation, SSI adds an algorithm for detecting serialization conflicts among writes and determining which transactions to abort.

The database knows which transactions may have acted on an outdated premise and need to be aborted by:
* **Detecting reads of a stale MVCC object version.** The database needs to track when a transaction ignores another transaction's writes due to MVCC visibility rules. When a transaction wants to commit, the database checks whether any of the ignored writes have now been committed. If so, the transaction must be aborted.
* **Detecting writes that affect prior reads.** As with two-phase locking, SSI uses index-range locks except that it does not block other transactions. When a transaction writes to the database, it must look in the indexes for any other transactions that have recently read the affected data. It simply notifies the transactions that the data they read may no longer be up to date.

##### Performance of serializable snapshot isolation

Compared to two-phase locking, the big advantage of SSI is that one transaction doesn't need to block waiting for locks held by another transaction. Writers don't block readers, and vice versa.

Compared to serial execution, SSI is not limited to the throughput of a single CPU core. Transactions can read and write data in multiple partitions while ensuring serializable isolation.

The rate of aborts significantly affects the overall performance of SSI. SSI requires that read-write transactions be fairly short (long-running read-only transactions may be okay).

## The trouble with distributed systems

### Faults and partial failures

A program on a single computer either works or it doesn't. There is no reason why software should be flaky (non deterministic).

In a distributed systems we have no choice but to confront the messy reality of the physical world. There will be parts that are broken in an unpredictable way, while others work. Partial failures are _nondeterministic_. Things will unpredicably fail.

We need to accept the possibility of partial failure and build fault-tolerant mechanism into the software. **We need to build a reliable system from unreliable components.**

### Unreliable networks

Focusing on _shared-nothing systems_ the network is the only way machines communicate.

The internet and most internal networks are _asynchronous packet networks_. A message is sent and the network gives no guarantees as to when it will arrive, or whether it will arrive at all. Things that could go wrong:
1. Request lost
2. Request waiting in a queue to be delivered later
3. Remote node may have failed
4. Remote node may have temporarily stoped responding
5. Response has been lost on the network
6. The response has been delayed and will be delivered later

If you send a request to another node and don't receive a response, it is _impossible_ to tell why.

**The usual way of handling this issue is a _timeout_**: after some time you give up waiting and assume that the response is not going to arrive.

Nobody is immune to network problems. You do need to know how your software reacts to network problems to ensure that the system can recover from them. It may make sense to deliberately trigger network problems and test the system's response.

If you want to be sure that a request was successful, you need a positive response from the application itself.

If something has gone wrong, you have to assume that you will get no response at all.

#### Timeouts and unbounded delays

A long timeout means a long wait until a node is declared dead. A short timeout detects faults faster, but carries a higher risk of incorrectly declaring a node dead (when it could be a slowdown).

Premature declaring a node is problematic, if the node is actually alive the action may end up being performed twice.

When a node is declared dead, its responsibilities need to be transferred to other nodes, which places additional load on other nodes and the network.

### Network congestion and queueing

- Different nodes try to send packets simultaneously to the same destination, the network switch must queue them and feed them to the destination one by one. The switch will discard packets when filled up.
- If CPU cores are busy, the request is queued by the operative system, until applications are ready to handle it.
- In virtual environments, the operative system is often paused while another virtual machine uses a CPU core. The VM queues the incoming data.
- TCP performs _flow control_, in which a node limits its own rate of sending in order to avoid overloading a network link or the receiving node. This means additional queuing at the sender.

You can choose timeouts experimentally by measuring the distribution of network round-trip times over an extended period.

Systems can continually measure response times and their variability (_jitter_), and automatically adjust timeouts according to the observed response time distribution.

#### Synchronous vs ashynchronous networks

A telephone network estabilishes a _circuit_, we say is _synchronous_ even as the data passes through several routers as it does not suffer from queing. The maximum end-to-end latency of the network is fixed (_bounded delay_).

A circuit is a fixed amount of reserved bandwidth which nobody else can use while the circuit is established, whereas packets of a TCP connection opportunistically use whatever network bandwidth is available.

**Using circuits for bursty data transfers wastes network capacity and makes transfer unnecessary slow. By contrast, TCP dinamycally adapts the rate of data transfer to the available network capacity.**

We have to assume that network congestion, queueing, and unbounded delays will happen. Consequently, there's no "correct" value for timeouts, they need to be determined experimentally.

### Unreliable clocks

The time when a message is received is always later than the time when it is sent, we don't know how much later due to network delays. This makes difficult to determine the order of which things happened when multiple machines are involved.

Each machine on the network has its own clock, slightly faster or slower than the other machines. It is possible to synchronise clocks with Network Time Protocol (NTP).

* **Time-of-day clocks**. Return the current date and time according to some calendar (_wall-clock time_). If the local clock is toof ar ahead of the NTP server, it may be forcibly reset and appear to jump back to a previous point in time. **This makes it is unsuitable for measuring elapsed time.**
* **Monotonic clocks**. Peg: `System.nanoTime()`. They are guaranteed to always move forward. The difference between clock reads can tell you how much time elapsed beween two checks. **The _absolute_ value of the clock is meaningless.** NTP allows the clock rate to be speeded up or slowed down by up to 0.05%, but **NTP cannot cause the monotonic clock to jump forward or backward**. **In a distributed system, using a monotonic clock for measuring elapsed time (peg: timeouts), is usually fine**.

If some piece of sofware is relying on an accurately synchronised clock, the result is more likely to be silent and subtle data loss than a dramatic crash.

You need to carefully monitor the clock offsets between all the machines.

#### Timestamps for ordering events

**It is tempting but dangerous to rely on clocks for ordering of events across multiple nodes.** This usually imply that _last write wins_ (LWW), often used in both multi-leader replication and leaderless databases like Cassandra and Riak, and data-loss may happen.

The definition of "recent" also depends on local time-of-day clock, which may well be incorrect.

_Logical clocks_, based on counters instead of oscillating quartz crystal, are safer alternative for ordering events.
